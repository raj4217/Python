Multple Linear Regression:
y = b0(constant)+b1x1+b2x2+....


Dummy Variable: Applies to Categorical Independent values(eg, state names etc). We use OneHotEncoder to create dummy variables for categorical columns.

Dummy variable trap: 
eg: 
New York
California
New York

we will create dummy variables as:

New York(D1)	California(D2)
1			0
0			1
1			0

now if we add both then the equation will look like
y = b0(constant)+b1x1+b2x2+....+b4D1+b5D2

but D2 = 1-D1

Now the phenomenon where one or several independent variables in a linear regression predict another is called multicollinearity and due to this the model cannot distinguish between the effects of D1 from the effects of D2 and hence the model wont work properly. This is called Dummy Variable trap.
